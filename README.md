# Linux Environment Initialization

Initialize my Linux Environment on Ubuntu. Also tested on Debian, so it should work on any Debian Based Distribution.

## Installation

To install run the following command to download and execute the installation script:

```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fatalus69/linux-init/refs/heads/master/install.sh | bash
```

Thats it and you're good to go.
